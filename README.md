## TensorMSA : Tensorflow Micro Service Architecture
**TensorMSA** is a framework for machine learning and deep learning. Main purpose of developing this framework is to provide automated pipe lines (data extraction > data preprocessing > train model > evaluate model > service model). Use of effective pipeline is really important when we proceed real project. There are so many hard tasks which has to be done to build data driven model. 

**Problems**
* Set up environment for deep learning is not a easy task (os, gpu, tensorflow, hadoop, etc..) 
* Build pipe line from data to train model 
* Difficulties of understading deep learning and implement those algorithms (even with tensorflow it's not that easy) 
* Manage model and data for service on legacy systems (usually works on Java)
* Build applications with using data driven models 
* Continuously update model by the environment and data changes 
* Hyper Parameter tunning for deep learning is also very exhausting job
* Managing and scheduling GPU server resource 

**Solutions**
* Easy to set up cluster with Docker images 
* Manage GPU resources with Celery and own job manager 
* REST APIs corresponding to Tensorflow
* JAVA API component interface with python REST APIS
* Easy to use UI for deep learning and machine learning 
* Pipe lines for various type of data and algorithms 
* Data collectors from various kind of source and types 
* Data preprocess for text, image and frame data sets 
* Support various deep learning and machine learning reusable componets 
* AutoML for hyperparameter tunning (genetic algorithm, random hp search, gpu cluster)

**Stack**
* Front End : React(ES6 + Webpack), Pure CSS + Scss, D3, jQuery Mobile(for Chatbot Client)
* Back End : Django(Python 3.5), Tensorflow(v1.2), Restful Service(Micro Service Architecture), PostgreSQL, Memcache, Celery, HDF5, Ngix, Gensim(W2V), Konlpy

## Overview - Framework introduction video 

Our framework provide easy to use UI/UX and AutoML based super easy process of build & service deep learning models
